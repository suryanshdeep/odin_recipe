    <h3>Description :</h3> Make <i>crispy</i> mashed potato pancakes that stay fluffy inside in a snap with leftover mashed potatoes. I like to make one large potato 
    pancake and slice it into wedges, but you can make individual-sized potato pancakes, which are easier to flip, if you prefer.

    <ol style="list-style-type:none">
        <li><strong>Step-1:</strong><br>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Step-2:</strong><br>Mix together mashed potatoes, potato starch, egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon of the chives in a medium bowl 
            until combined. The mixture should be slightly sticky but not loose. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-3:</strong><br>Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a 10-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until hot and oil is fragrant. Spoon potato
             mixture into skillet and press it into an even layer to create a potato pancake about 9 inches in diameter. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-4</strong><br>Reduce heat to medium; cover skillet with a lid or flat cookie sheet and cook, giving skillet a 90-degree turn every 2 to 3 
            minutes, until golden brown around the edges and top of pancake feels almost dry to the touch, 8  to 9 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-5</strong><br>Slide potato pancake onto a large plate. Spray another large plate with nonstick cooking spray and invert the potato pancake 
            onto greased plate. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-6</strong><br>Add remaining 1 teaspoon oil to skillet and heat over medium. Slide pancake back into skillet and cook, uncovered, until golden 
            brown on the other side, about 5 more minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step-7</strong><br>Slide pancake onto a cutting board and garnish with remaining 1 teaspoon chives. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-8</strong><br>Slice into 8 wedges and serve immediately.<em>Enjoy!</em></li>
