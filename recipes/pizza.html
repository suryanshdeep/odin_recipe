    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol style="list-style-type:none">
        <li><strong>Step-1:</strong><br>Stir flour and 1 teaspoon salt in a bowl. Set aside</li>
        <li><strong>Step-2:</strong><br>Mix water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes </li>
        <li><strong>Step-3:</strong><br>Stir half the flour mixture into yeast mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time,
             mixing well after each addition. When dough pulls together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 
             about 8 minutes. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-4</strong><br>Lightly oil a large bowl, then place dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a 
            warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Punch dough down, divide into 4 equal pieces, and form each 
            into a ball. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-5</strong><br>Preheat oven with a pizza stone to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step-6</strong><br>Stretch out and pat 1 dough ball to form a circle 10 to 12 inches in diameter. Place dough on a lightly floured pizza peel. 
            Top with 1/2 cup of tomato sauce and spread to cover within an inch of the edge of the dough. Arrange 5 slices of mozzarella cheese on top of the tomato 
            sauce, then place 5 basil leaves on top. Drizzle pizza with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with sea salt to taste. Repeat for 3 remaining dough balls. </li>
        <li><strong>Step-7</strong><br>Slide each pizza onto the pizza stone in the preheated oven. Bake until cheese is bubbly and the underside of the crust is
             golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes </li>
        <li><strong>Step-8</strong><br>Slice into 8 wedges and serve immediately.<em>Enjoy!</em></li>
